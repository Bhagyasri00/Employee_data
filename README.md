# Analyzing Workforce Data: A PostgreSQL and Spyder Approach

In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of employee data using PostgreSQL as our database management system and Spyder IDE for data analysis. The project aimed to gain insights into various aspects of employee information, including salary distributions, tenure analysis, and managerial insights.

# Database Structure:
The Employee_data database comprises six tables:

- **Department**: Stores information about different departments within the company.

- **Department_Employee**: Represents the relationship between employees and departments, indicating which employees belong to which departments and their employment dates.

- **Department_Manager**: Records managerial assignments for each department, specifying which employee is managing which department and the dates of their managerial role.

- **Salary**: Stores salary information for each employee, including their salary amount and the dates when the salary was effective.

- **Employee**: Contains detailed information about each employee, such as their name, hire date, and possibly other personal information.

- **Title**: Stores job title information for each employee, indicating their job title and the dates when the title was effective.
