# Analyzing Workforce Data: A PostgreSQL and Spyder Approach

In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of employee data using PostgreSQL as our database management system and Spyder IDE for data analysis. The project aimed to gain insights into various aspects of employee information, including salary distributions, tenure analysis, and managerial insights.

# Database Structure:
The Employee_data database comprises six tables:

employees: Contains employee information such as employee ID, name, and hire date.
departments: Lists all departments within the company, including department ID and name.
salaries: Records salary information for each employee, including salary amount and dates.
titles: Contains job title information for each employee, including title and dates.
dept_emp: Links employees to their respective departments, including department ID and employment dates.
dept_manager: Lists managers for each department, including manager ID and department ID.
